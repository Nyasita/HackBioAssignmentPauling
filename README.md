# HackBioPauling
 
## Hello Everyone,
**Welcome to #Pauling!** :smile:
This is a group of enthusiastic people awarded the #HackBio Internship and are deeply interested in programming and bioinformatics.
HackBio is a 5-weeks virtual research internship that is practice oriented and focused on equipping scientists globally with advanced bioinformatics and computational biology skills. HackBio is open to all i.e. does not have eligibility restrictions, interview hustles nor exams, is cost free and only requires a PC and workspace to get started.
HackBio has 4 main _goals_, as highlighted below:
1.    Expand the bioinformatics capabilities of African scientists 
2.    Improve networking among young African scientists 
3.    Accelerate bioinformatics discoveries in Africa 
4.    Increase public understanding of biological science and its implications for our world

At the end of the internship, successful interns should have: 
+ Honed their skills in a specific bioinformatics method 
+ Have at least a peer-reviewed article to show for the internship experience

### The HackBio internship happens in 5 stages as listed below :point_down:
+	**STAGE 0:** Pruning those that are complete novice and are not ready to learn-on-the-go. Simple tasks (3 days) 
+	**STAGE 1:** Achieve digital collaboration with common tools among participants; anyone who is unable to collaborate will be eliminated (4 days) 
+	**STAGE 2:** Distribution of individuals into different biostacks, as it applies to the theme. Preliminary tasks on usage of software, linux environment and basic language debugging. (1 week; 60 persons scale through and enter stage 2) 
+	**STAGE 3:** Reshuffling of individuals into 5 teams and assignment of the 5 projects. All participants who get to this stage will receive a badge of honor. (1 week; 40 persons scale through and enter stage 4) 
+	**STAGE 4:** Submission of all results in their raw form, all codes, designs and final manuscript draft ready for submission.
 
### Areas of specialization and applications in bioinformatics included in the internship are:
+	genomics 
+	drug development 
+	vaccine informatics
+	medicinal chemistry 
+	cheminformatics 
+	data analytics 
+	software development 
+	science communication 
+	publication image design 
+	bioinformatics frontend/UI/UX

With that said check out our awesome contributors below.:smiley:
